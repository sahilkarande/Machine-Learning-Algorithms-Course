# 📘 Introduction to Machine Learning

## 🤖 What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** where machines are trained to perform tasks **without being explicitly programmed**.  
The primary goal of ML is to **understand the structure of data** and build models that can learn patterns and make predictions or decisions.

## 🔑 Characteristics of Machine Learning
1. Learns relationships between data.  
2. Predicts outcomes/events for new/unseen data.  
3. Improves performance with experience (learning from data).

## 📊 Applications of Machine Learning
- **Healthcare** → Medical diagnostics, cancer & tumor detection.  
- **Transportation** → Traffic prediction, self-driving cars (e.g., Tesla).  
- **Email & Security** → Spam email filtering, fraud detection.  
- **Entertainment** → Personalized recommendations on Netflix, YouTube, Amazon.  
- **Translation & NLP** → Automatic language translation (Google Translate), speech recognition (Siri, Alexa, Cortana).  
- **Finance** → Stock market trading, credit risk scoring.  
- **Computer Vision** → Face detection, image recognition, device unlocking.
