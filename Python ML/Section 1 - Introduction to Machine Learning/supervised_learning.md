# 📘 Supervised Learning

## 🔎 What is Supervised Learning?
The term **"supervise"** refers to the act of watching and directing a task or operation.  
In Machine Learning, **Supervised Learning** uses **labeled training data** — a collection of input–output pairs — to estimate a function.

- The algorithm is provided with **example inputs (X)** along with their **corresponding outputs (Y)**.  
- The model learns by comparing its predicted outputs with the **true labels**, identifying errors, and adjusting accordingly.  
- Once trained, the model can **predict labels for unseen (unlabeled) data**.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Provide the model with **training data that has labels**.  
   Example: Shapes labeled as **square** or **triangle**.  
2. The model learns the relationship between **inputs and labels**.  
3. For new test data, the model predicts whether the input belongs to **square** or **triangle**.

## 📊 Applications of Supervised Learning
- **Finance** → Predict stock market fluctuations using historical data.  
- **Healthcare** → Classify medical images (e.g., tumor detection).  
- **Security** → Email spam detection.  
- **Computer Vision** → Classify images of dogs, cats, or objects.  
- **Voice Recognition** → Identify spoken words using labeled audio datasets.

## 📌 Key Point
Supervised learning uses **patterns in labeled data** to generalize and make predictions about new, unseen data.
