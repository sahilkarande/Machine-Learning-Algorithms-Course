# 📘 Unsupervised Learning

## 🔎 What is Unsupervised Learning?
As the name suggests, **Unsupervised Learning** works with **unlabeled data**.  
The algorithm is not given predefined outputs — instead, it must **discover patterns, relationships, or structures** within the data.

- Input: Raw, unlabeled data.  
- Task: Find hidden structures (e.g., clusters or groupings).  
- Output: Groups or patterns formed based on similarity.  

Example: If provided with a dataset of animal images, the algorithm may group **dogs** and **cats** separately based on features, even though no labels were given.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Provide raw data **without labels**.  
2. The algorithm analyzes similarities and differences.  
3. Data is grouped into **clusters** (e.g., dogs vs cats).

## 📊 Applications of Unsupervised Learning
- **Market Segmentation** → Grouping customers based on buying behavior.  
- **Social Networks** → Detecting communities or clusters of users.  
- **Healthcare** → Identifying unknown disease subtypes from patient data.  
- **Recommender Systems** → Finding similarities in user preferences.  
- **Computer Vision** → Object detection without labeled datasets.

## 📌 Key Point
Unsupervised learning is especially valuable when **labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain**, as it allows machines to **discover hidden patterns automatically**.
