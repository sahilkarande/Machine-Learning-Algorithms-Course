# ⚙️ Section 2: Implementing ML Algorithms in Python

## 📘 Introduction
By now, we have a solid understanding of **what Machine Learning is** and its fundamental concepts.  
In this section, we’ll start diving into **practical implementations** using Python.

Before coding, we need to set up a suitable environment. The programming language we’ll use throughout this course is **Python**.

## 📚 Popular Python Libraries for ML
Some of the most important libraries we’ll use are:
- **NumPy** → Numerical computations, arrays, linear algebra.  
- **Pandas** → Data manipulation and analysis (DataFrames).  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** → Data visualization.  
- **Scikit-learn (sklearn)** → Core ML algorithms and utilities.  
- **SciPy** → Advanced scientific computations.
