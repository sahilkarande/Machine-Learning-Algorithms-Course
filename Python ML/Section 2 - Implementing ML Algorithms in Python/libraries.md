## 1Ô∏è‚É£ NumPy
- **NumPy** (Numerical Python) is the foundation of scientific computing in Python.  
- It provides:
  - Efficient handling of **large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices**.  
  - A vast collection of **high-level mathematical functions** to operate on these arrays.  
- Many other ML libraries (like Pandas, SciPy, Scikit-learn) are built on top of NumPy.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ SciPy
- **SciPy** is used for **scientific and technical computing**.  
- It builds on NumPy and provides additional functionality, including:
  - Optimization  
  - Linear Algebra  
  - Integration  
  - Signal & Image Processing  
  - Special mathematical functions  
- Widely used in science, research, and engineering applications.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Matplotlib
- **Matplotlib** is a powerful **data visualization library**.  
- It allows you to create static, interactive, and animated plots.  
- Works seamlessly with NumPy arrays and Pandas DataFrames.  
- Often used in combination with **Seaborn** for advanced, aesthetically pleasing plots.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Pandas
- **Pandas** is designed for **data manipulation and analysis**.  
- Key features:
  - Provides **DataFrames** and **Series** for handling structured/tabular data.  
  - Tools for **cleaning, reshaping, aggregating, and analyzing datasets**.  
  - Great for handling **time series data**.  
- Considered one of the most essential libraries for any data scientist.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Scikit-learn (sklearn)
- **Scikit-learn** is a free, open-source **machine learning library**.  
- Built on top of **NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib**.  
- Provides easy-to-use implementations of:
  - Classification  
  - Regression  
  - Clustering  
  - Dimensionality reduction  
  - Model selection & evaluation  
- One of the most widely used ML libraries for beginners and professionals alike.
